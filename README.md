# Colorlight-5A-75B-Programming-Adapter

A programming adapter to use either a USB Blaster or FT230X to program the FPGA on the Colorlight 5A-75B.

This design is intended to use the USB Blaster to program the ECP5 FPGA on the Colorlight 5A-75B and with the option of using a FT230X, provided the functionality is built out.

Note: The FT230X approach hasn't been developed. I included it here for future development.
